# Server (Still working on)

Making a server from scratch using Tokio.

## Things to Work on
1. Setting up the HTTP stream correctly to use http request functions instead of the bytes
2. Create an index.html page
3. On the index.html page have the following informaton
* Show IP Address
* Show if the server has node js installed and what version
* Show if the server has rust installed and what version
* Show if python is installed and what version
4. See how to deploy it on the network so other computers on the same network can see it
